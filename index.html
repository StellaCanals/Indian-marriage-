        <h1> 💐What are the Hindu Wedding Traditions?💐 </h1>
        <p> 🌷Briefly mentioned above were the 15 Hindu wedding traditions that usually take place at a Hindu wedding. However, don’t be alarmed if you’re reading the titles still have no idea what they mean! We have given a brief description of what each Hindu wedding tradition consists of, so you can be fully prepared when arriving as a guest at a Hindu wedding.🌷 </p>
        <h2> 🐞The Baraat / The Jaan🐞 </h2>
        <p> 🌼The Baraat is where the festivities begin. In Hindu and Sikh weddings, the Groom is led to the marriage venue in a procession known as the Baraat. Usually, the Groom will be accompanied by family, groomsmen and friends are known as barratis. Typically the Groom will be on a horse or elephant with fantastic music which sets the mood for the rest of the marriage celebrations. These are often upbeat and exciting songs.🌼 </p>
        <h2> 🌻Pokwanu – Welcoming of The Groom🌻 </h2>
        <p> 🌸The Pokwanu is where the bride’s family formally welcomes the Groom and his guests. The Bride’s mother will apply a tilak on the Groom’s forehead and will then escort him and his family into the venue. Once inside, the priest will perform a brief ceremony. After this, the Groom will then be asked to smash a clay pot with his foot breaking it into pieces. This demonstrates his ability to overcome all obstacles the couple may face in married life. The Groom is then escorted into the Mandap.🌸 </p>
        <h2> 🌹Kanya Aagman – The Arrival of the Bride🌹 </h2>
        <p> 🌺The bride will be escorted to the Mandap by her uncles. Once inside, verses are chanted as the veil is lowered and the couple exchange flower garlands. To declare that the bride has chosen the groom of her own free will, she will offer the flower first. To return the compliment, the groom will then offer his flower garland.🌺 </p>
        <h2> ❤️Granthibandan and Varmala❤️ </h2>
        <p> 💝The bride and groom will chant prayers to Lord Shiva, Goddess Parvati, Lord Narayan and Goddess Laxmi Devi, asking for marriage as strong as theirs. The groom’s scarf will be tied to the bride’s shawl and the knot symbolises two souls joined together.💝 </p>
        <h2> 💛Kanyadan💛 </h2>
        <p> 💖This is where the bride’s parents give away their daughter to the groom.💖 </p>
        <h2> 💜Havan💜 </h2>
        <p> 💙The Havan is a sacrificial fire tradition. It is performed in a square-shaped Kunda, which combines the vertical element of fire with the horizontal elements of fire and earth. Often ghee, rice and flowers will be put into the flame.💙 </p>
        <h2> 🧡Mangal Fera🧡 </h2>
        <p> 💚This is where the couple circles the holy fire four times as the priest chants Mantras. The first three of the circles are led by the groom, whilst the fourth is led by the bride. This is to signify balance within the marriage. Once complete, the bride and groom race back to their seats. As part of the Hindu wedding tradition, it is said whoever sits in their seat first will be the ruler of the household.💚 </p>
